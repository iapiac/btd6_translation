# BTD6 translation
Yes, this is to track BTD6 translation.  
I just want to know if or how NK changes it.  
(If you use English only, please ignore it)  
  
Check commit history to get what they changed.  
Also, you can download releases for every version.
  
Use [AssetStudio](https://github.com/Perfare/AssetStudio) to get TextAssets and export them.
